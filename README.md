# QRT-Stock-Return-Prediction

<b> finding_lagging_stocks.ipynb </b> Shows the dynamic time warping between an individual stock, and the mean of all stocks in the same sector (on the same date). The idea is that individual stocks 'lag' behind the market. We had planned to identify how far certain stocks lag behind the market, and then use this as an additional feature for our model.
